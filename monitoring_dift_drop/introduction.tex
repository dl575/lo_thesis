\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:monitoring_dift_drop.introduction}

In the last chapter, we described a hardware architecture that dynamically
limits the amount of monitoring performed in order to meet hard real-time
deadlines. This allows run-time monitoring to be implemented even when the
worst-case impact of performing full monitoring cannot be tolerated. 
For some of these monitoring techniques, even the average or typical case
overheads can be prohibitively high depending on the application and system
requirements.  Thus, in this chapter, we explore the use of similar hardware
techniques in order to enable a new trade-off dimension for run-time monitor
designs.  We propose to enable low overhead monitors by using partial
monitoring. This enables a trade-off between overhead and
monitoring coverage or accuracy. 

We enable partial monitoring with adjustable overhead by dynamically dropping
monitoring operations when the overhead exceeds a specified overhead budget.
Similar to the architecture presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:monitoring_hard_drop}, we must again be careful to prevent
false positives due to out-of-date metadata information. In order to prevent
these false positives, we use an invalidation-based approach as before.
However, here we back up the invalidation flags to memory and do not have
aliasing. The result is that the hardware effectively acts as a dataflow
tracking engine. We show how a simple extension to this dataflow engine can
enable null metadata filtering. In addition, we investigate different policies
for deciding which events to drop for partial monitoring.  These different
policies show a trade-off between closely matching the overhead budget and
increasing the monitoring coverage.

This chapter is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:monitoring_dift_drop.monitoring} introduces the notion of
adjustable overhead through partial monitoring.
Section~\ref{sec:monitoring_dift_drop.dropping} discusses the hardware
architecture that enables partial monitoring using our dataflow tracking
engine.  Section~\ref{sec:monitoring_dift_drop.policies} investigates the
design space for dropping policies that determine when and which monitoring
operations to drop.  Section~\ref{sec:monitoring_dift_drop.evaluation} presents
our evaluation methodology and results.
